I would like to talk about the “DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION”

A change which we all are seeing in our surrounding is really something which makes me talk about the digital transformation. Right from starting if we talk about the digital transformation I would like to convey about the message that we are in era of AI(ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE) & ML(MACHINE LEARNING)	. this is a huge change for our industries. A change that we have all seen in future was a Industrial revolution . but as time passes away we need to change according to the time , in that way a time has to come for one more revolution this revolution was digital revolution which changed the whole world .

Now from buying to selling everything are being done digitally. Even now a days doctors have also come to check patient digitally . the transformation of manual work to digital work is call digital transformation.
