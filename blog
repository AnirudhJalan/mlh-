I would like to thank each and every member of the MLH group who were there to support us till the end of the program I would like to thank all of my guild members to help me out.
I had a very mind blowing experience of this event; it’s for the first time I am feeling like to do coding and to learn the new skills. This hackathon has boost my confidence and helped me to grow more . the way they have conducted the event was superb and most important in this hackathon which I saw was that they have touch every field of the hackers life, they have paid attention over communication skills and so that we all can have good communication by giving us task to create a video and to go for live stream and most important they focused on our networking even so they gave us the task to share the meal with each other. They have focused on the gamming part even they want us that we explore every part of the field and get enthusiast in life that’s what makes them special . and to be honestly speaking  I have learned a lot from this hackathon.
thanking you for such beautiful event.
